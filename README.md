# Autism-Detection-Model-for-Early-Childhood-Screening
Developed a SVM model to detect early signs of autism in children aged 0-3, achieving 93% accuracy and receiving prestigious recognition for its innovative approach.

##Overview
This project focuses on detecting autism in early childhood using machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes two main notebooks:

- **Autism_model.ipynb:** Trains the SVM model on a verified dataset, provides code for model evaluation with confusion matrices, and visualizes results.

- **Autism_input_model.ipynb:** Allows users to input data for autism screening, applying machine learning techniques based on the trained model.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Suport Vector Machine(SVM)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
